CM3202-FoursquareMapExample
===========================

Example application putting nightlife spots from Foursquare on a map, from the CM3202 Emerging Technologies lecture, 18th February 2014

You'll need your own client_id and client_secret from Foursquare, and a cloudmade API key for the map tiles.

Any and all problems with the code are entirely of your own imagination.
